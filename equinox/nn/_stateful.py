    means that the model must keep a copy of the initial state around, in case
    `eqx.nn.State` is called on it again. This extra copy consumes extra memory.

    But in practice, it is quite common to only need to initialise the state once. In
    this case, we can use this function to delete this extra copy, and in doing so save
    some memory.
