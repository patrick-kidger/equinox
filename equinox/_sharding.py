    """Filtered transform combining `jax.lax.with_sharding_constraint`
    and `jax.device_put`.

    Enforces sharding within a JIT'd computation (That is, how an array is
    split between multiple devices, i.e. multiple GPUs/TPUs.), or moves `x` to
    a device.

    **Arguments:**

    - `x`: A PyTree, with potentially a mix of arrays and non-arrays on the leaves.
        They will have their shardings constrained.
    - `device_or_shardings`: Either a singular device (e.g. CPU or GPU) or PyTree of
        sharding specifications. The structure should be a prefix of `x`.

    **Returns:**

    A copy of `x` with the specified sharding constraints.

    !!! Example
        See also the [autoparallelism example](../examples/parallelism.ipynb).
