    is_leaf: Optional[Callable[[Any], bool]] = None,
):
    """Modifies a PyTree out-of-place. (A bit like using `.at[].set()` on a JAX array.)

    **Arguments:**

    - `where`: A callable `PyTree -> Node` or `PyTree -> tuple[Node, ...]`. It should
        consume a PyTree with the same structure as `pytree`, and return the node or
        nodes that should be replaced. For example
        `where = lambda mlp: mlp.layers[-1].linear.weight`.
    - `pytree`: The PyTree to modify.
    - `replace`: Either a single element, or a sequence of the same length as returned
        by `where`. This specifies the replacements to make at the locations specified
        by `where`. Mutually exclusive with `replace_fn`.
    - `replace_fn`: A function `Node -> Any`. It will be called on every node specified
        by `where`. The return value from `replace_fn` will be used in its place.
        Mutually exclusive with `replace`.
    - `is_leaf`: As `jtu.tree_flatten`. For example pass `is_leaf=lambda x: x is None`
        to be able to replace `None` values using `tree_at`.

    Note that `where` should not depend on the type of any of the leaves of the
    pytree, e.g. given `pytree = [1, 2, object(), 3]`, then
    `where = lambda x: tuple(xi for xi in x if type(xi) is int)` is not allowed. If you
    really need this behaviour then this example could instead be expressed as
    `where = lambda x: tuple(xi for xi, yi in zip(x, pytree) if type(yi) is int)`.

    **Returns:**

    A copy of the input PyTree, with the appropriate modifications.

    !!! Example

        ```python
        # Here is a pytree
        tree = [1, [2, {"a": 3, "b": 4}]]
        new_leaf = 5
        get_leaf = lambda t: t[1][1]["a"]
        new_tree = eqx.tree_at(get_leaf, tree, 5)
        # new_tree is [1, [2, {"a": 5, "b": 4}]]
        # The original tree is unchanged.
        ```

    !!! Example

        This is useful for performing model surgery. For example:
        ```python
        mlp = eqx.nn.MLP(...)
        new_linear = eqx.nn.Linear(...)
        get_last_layer = lambda m: m.layers[-1]
        new_mlp = eqx.tree_at(get_last_layer, mlp, new_linear)
        ```

    # We need to specify a particular node in a PyTree.
    # This is surprisingly difficult to do! As far as I can see, pretty much the only
    # way of doing this is to specify e.g. `x.foo[0].bar` via `is`, and then pulling
    # a few tricks to try and ensure that the same object doesn't appear multiple
    # times in the same PyTree.
    #
    # So this first `tree_map` serves a dual purpose.
    # 1) Makes a copy of the composite nodes in the PyTree, to avoid aliasing via
    #    e.g. `pytree=[(1,)] * 5`. This has the tuple `(1,)` appear multiple times.
    # 2) It makes each leaf be a unique Python object, as it's wrapped in
    #    `_LeafWrapper`. This is needed because Python caches a few builtin objects:
    #    `assert 0 + 1 is 1`. I think only a few leaf types are subject to this.
    # So point 1) should ensure that all composite nodes are unique Python objects,
    # and point 2) should ensure that all leaves are unique Python objects.
    # Between them, all nodes of `pytree` are handled.
    #
    # I think pretty much the only way this can fail is when using a custom node with
    # singleton-like flatten+unflatten behaviour, which is pretty edge case. And we've
    # added a check for it at the bottom of this function, just to be sure.
    #
    # Whilst we're here: we also double-check that `where` is well-formed and doesn't
    # use leaf information. (As else `node_or_nodes` will be wrong.)
