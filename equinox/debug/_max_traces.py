def assert_max_traces(fn: Callable = sentinel, *, max_traces: Optional[int]):
    """Asserts that the wrapped callable is not called more than `max_traces` times.

    The typical use-case for this is to check that a JIT-compiled function is not
    compiled more than `max_traces` times. (I.e. this function can be used to guard
    against bugs.) In this case it should be placed within the JIT wrapper.

    !!! Example

        ```python
        @eqx.filter_jit
        @eqx.debug.assert_max_traces(max_traces=1)
        def f(x, y):
            return x + y
        ```

    **Arguments:**

    - `fn`: The callable to wrap.
    - `max_traces`: keyword only argument. The maximum number of calls that are
        allowed. Can be `None` to allow arbitrarily many calls; in this case the number
        of calls can still can be found via [`equinox.debug.get_num_traces`][].

    **Returns:**

    A wrapped version of `fn` that tracks the number of times it is called. This will
    raise a `RuntimeError` if is called more than `max_traces` many times.

    !!! info

        See also
        [`chex.assert_max_traces`](https://github.com/google-deepmind/chex#jax-tracing-assertions)
        which provides similar functionality.

        The differences are that (a) Chex's implementation is a bit stricter, as the
        following will raise:
        ```python
        import chex
        import jax

        def f(x):
            pass

        f2 = jax.jit(chex.assert_max_traces(f, 1))
        f3 = jax.jit(chex.assert_max_traces(f, 1))

        f2(1)
        f3(1)  # will raise, despite the fact that f2 and f3 are different.
        ```
        and (b) Equinox's implementation supports non-function callables.

        You may prefer the Chex version if you prefer the stricter raising behaviour of
        the above code.
