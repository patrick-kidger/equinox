    "# Serialising both weights and hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Equinox has [facilities](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/api/serialisation/) for the serialisation of the leaves of arbitrary PyTrees. The most basic use is to call `eqx.tree_serialise_leaves(filename, model)` to write all weights to a file. Deserialisation requires a PyTree of the correct shape to serve as a \"skeleton\" of sorts, whose weights are then read from the file with `model = eqx.tree_deserialise_leaves(filename, skeleton)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a typical model has both weights (arrays stored as leaves in the PyTree) and hyperparameters (the size of the network, etc.). When deserialising, we would like to read the hyperparameters as well as the weights. Ideally they should be stored in the same file. We can accomplish this as follows."

    "First, Equinox and JAX make rich use of unpickleable quantities, e.g. `lambda` expressions. This can potentially be cured by using another package (e.g. [`dill`](https://pypi.org/project/dill/) or [`cloudpickle`](https://pypi.org/project/cloudpickle/)).\n",

    "Third, unpickling loads and runs arbitrary code. When you download an open-source model, this can be a serious security concern! We all expect a file named `*.py` to be potentially malicious, but a file ostensibly containing \"just floating-point numbers\" should be safe to use from an untrusted source. The methods described above allow weights to be shared safely as long as the underlying model code is trusted; the serialised file really is interpreted as just an array of numbers.\n",

    "* If you serialise/deserialise between training and inference, and you are using [`equinox.nn.BatchNorm`][], [`equinox.nn.Dropout`][] etc., then make sure to set your desired inference flag when loading. Perhaps make this a required argument to `make(...)`.\n",
