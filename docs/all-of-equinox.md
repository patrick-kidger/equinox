# All of Equinox

Equinox is a small and easy to understand library. So as the title suggests, this page tells you essentially everything you need to know to use Equinox.

## Parameterised functions as PyTrees

As we saw on the [Getting Started](./index.md) page, Equinox represents parameterised functions as [PyTrees](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pytrees.html).

!!! example

    A neural network is a function parameterised by its weights, biases, etc.

    But you can use Equinox to represent any kind of parameterised function! For example [Diffrax](http://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax) uses Equinox to represent numerical differential equation solvers.

And now you can JIT/grad/etc. with respect to your model. For example, using a few built-in layers by way of demonstration:

```python
import equinox as eqx
import jax

class MyModule(eqx.Module):
    layers: list
    extra_bias: jax.Array

    def __init__(self, key):
        key1, key2, key3 = jax.random.split(key, 3)
        self.layers = [eqx.nn.Linear(2, 8, key=key1),
                       eqx.nn.Linear(8, 8, key=key2),
                       eqx.nn.Linear(8, 2, key=key3)]
        # This is a trainable parameter.
        self.extra_bias = jax.numpy.ones(2)

    def __call__(self, x):
        for layer in self.layers[:-1]:
            x = jax.nn.relu(layer(x))
        return self.layers[-1](x) + self.extra_bias

@jax.jit
@jax.grad
def loss(model, x, y):
    pred_y = jax.vmap(model)(x)
    return jax.numpy.mean((y - pred_y) ** 2)

x_key, y_key, model_key = jax.random.split(jax.random.PRNGKey(0), 3)
x = jax.random.normal(x_key, (100, 2))
y = jax.random.normal(y_key, (100, 2))
model = MyModule(model_key)
grads = loss(model, x, y)
learning_rate = 0.1
model = jax.tree_util.tree_map(lambda m, g: m - learning_rate * g, model, grads)
```

## Filtering

In the previous example, all of the model attributes were `Module`s and JAX arrays. To be precise: the overall model was a PyTree of JAX arrays.

Equinox supports using arbitrary Python objects too. (That is, the model is a PyTree of arbitrary Python objects, which may or may not include JAX arrays.) Equinox offers the tools to handle these appropriately around transforms like `jax.jit` and `jax.grad`. (Which themselves only work with JAX arrays.)

!!! example

    The activation function in [`equinox.nn.MLP`][] isn't a JAX array -- it's a Python function.

!!! example

    You might have a `bool`-ean flag in your model-as-a-PyTree, specifying whether to enable some extra piece of behaviour. You might want to treat that as a `static_argnum` to `jax.jit`.

If you want to do this, then Equinox offers *filtering*, as follows.

**Create a model**

Start off by creating a model just like normal, now with some arbitrary Python objects as part of its parameterisation. In this case, we have `jax.nn.relu`, which is a Python function.

```python
import equinox as eqx
import functools as ft
import jax

class AnotherModule(eqx.Module):
    layers: list

    def __init__(self, key):
        key1, key2 = jax.random.split(key)
        self.layers = [eqx.nn.Linear(2, 8, key=key1),
                       jax.nn.relu,
                       eqx.nn.Linear(8, 2, key=key2)]

    def __call__(self, x):
        for layer in self.layers:
            x = layer(x)
        return x

x_key, y_key, model_key = jax.random.split(jax.random.PRNGKey(0), 3)
x, y = jax.random.normal(x_key, (100, 2)), jax.random.normal(y_key, (100, 2))
model = AnotherModule(model_key)
```

**Option 1: use `eqx.{partition,combine}`**

```python
@ft.partial(jax.jit, static_argnums=1)
@jax.grad
def loss(params, static, x, y):
    model = eqx.combine(params, static)
    pred_y = jax.vmap(model)(x)
    return jax.numpy.mean((y - pred_y) ** 2)

params, static = eqx.partition(model, eqx.is_array)
loss(params, static, x, y)
```

Here, `params` and `static` are both instances of `AnotherModule`: `params` keeps just the leaves that are JAX arrays; `static` keeps everything else. Then `combine` merges the two PyTrees back together after crossing the `jax.jit` and `jax.grad` API boundaries.

The choice of `eqx.is_array` is a *filter function*: a boolean function specifying whether each leaf should go into `params` or into `static`. In this case very simply `eqx.is_array(x)` returns `True` for JAX and NumPy arrays, and `False` for everything else.

**Option 2: use filtered transformations**

```python
@eqx.filter_jit
@eqx.filter_grad
def loss(model, x, y):
    pred_y = jax.vmap(model)(x)
    return jax.numpy.mean((y - pred_y) ** 2)

loss(model, x, y)
```

As a convenience, `eqx.filter_jit` and `eqx.filter_grad` wrap filtering and transformation together. It turns out to be really common to only need to filter around JAX transformations.

If your models only use JAX arrays, then `eqx.filter_{jit,grad,...}` will do exactly the same as `jax.{jit,grad,...}`. So if you just want to keep things simple, it is safe to just always use `eqx.filter_{jit,grad,...}`.

Both approaches are equally valid. Some people prefer to explicitly see the `jax.{jit,grad,...}` operations without using a wrapper. Some people prefer a shorter syntax instead.

## Integrates smoothly with JAX

Equinox introduces a powerful yet straightforward way to build neural networks, without introducing lots of new notions or tieing you into a framework.

Equinox is all just regular JAX -- PyTrees and transformations. Together, these two pieces allow us to specify complex models in JAX-friendly ways.

## Summary

Equinox includes four main things:

- For building models: `equinox.Module`.
- Prebuilt neural network layers: `equinox.nn.Linear`, `equinox.nn.Conv2d`, etc.
- Filtering, and filtered transformations: `equinox.partition`, `equinox.filter_jit` etc.
- Other useful tools: for serialisation, manipulating PyTrees, etc.

See also the API reference on the left.

## Next steps

And that's it! That's pretty much everything you need to know about Equinox. Everything you've seen so far should be enough to get started with using the library. Also see the [Train RNN](./examples/train_rnn.ipynb) example for a fully worked example.

!!! faq "FAQ"

    One common question: a lot of other libraries introduce custom `library.jit` etc. operations, specifically to work with `library.Module`. What makes the filtered transformations of Equinox different?

    The answer is that filtered transformations and `eqx.Module` are not coupled together; they are independent tools. Filtered transformations work with any PyTree. And `eqx.Module`s just happens to be a PyTree.
