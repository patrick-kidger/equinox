# Manipulating PyTrees

!!! tip

    [`equinox.tree_at`][] is one of the most useful utilities available here, which allows for performing surgery (out-of-place updates) on PyTrees.

## Filtering, partitioning, combining

::: equinox.filter

::: equinox.is_array

::: equinox.is_array_like

::: equinox.is_inexact_array

::: equinox.is_inexact_array_like

---

::: equinox.partition

---

::: equinox.combine

## Common operations on PyTrees

::: equinox.apply_updates

---

::: equinox.tree_at

---

::: equinox.tree_equal

---

::: equinox.Partial
    selection:
        members:
            - __init__
            - __call__

## Unusual operations on PyTrees

::: equinox.tree_flatten_one_level

---

::: equinox.tree_check
