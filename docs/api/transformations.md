# Transformations

These offer an alternate (easier to use) API for JAX transformations.

For example, JAX uses `jax.jit(..., static_argnums=...)` to manually indicate which arguments should be treated dynamically/statically. Meanwhile `equinox.filter_jit` automatically treats all JAX/NumPy arrays dynamically, and everything else statically. Moreover, this is done at the level of individual PyTree leaves, so that unlike `jax.jit`, one argment can have both dynamic (array-valued) and static leaves.

Most users find that this is a simpler API when working with complicated PyTrees, such as are produced when using Equinox modules. But you can also still use Equinox with normal `jax.jit` etc. if you so prefer.
