# Filtered transformations

These typically combine [`equinox.partition`][], a [filter function](./filter-functions.md), and a JAX transformation, all together.

Practically speaking these are usually the only kind of filtering you ever have to use. (But it's good to understand what e.g. [`equinox.partition`][] and [`equinox.is_array`][] are doing under the hood, just so that these don't seem too magical.)
