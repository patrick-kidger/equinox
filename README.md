<h2 align='center'>Callable PyTrees and filtered JIT/grad transformations<br>=> neural networks in JAX</h2>

Equinox brings more power to your model building in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).<br>
Represent *parameterised functions as data*, and use *filtered transformations* for powerful fine-grained control of the model-building process.

Equinox is half tech-demo, half neural network library.

## Equinox in brief

### Building neural networks

Build models using a PyTorch-like class based API *without* sacrificing JAX-like functional programming.

In particular, *without* extra complexity like class-to-functional transformations, custom notions of parameter groups, or specially wrapped `library.jit`s and `library.grad`s, like many libraries have.

Equinox is a tiny library -- no behind-the-scenes magic, guaranteed.
The elegance of Equinox is its selling point in a world that already has [Haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku), [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax) etc.

### Technical contributions

Equinox represents *parameterised functions as data*. That is, you can represent your whole model (parameters, buffers, forward pass, etc.) as a [PyTree](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pytrees.html). Parameterised functions can be passed in and out of higher-order functions -- like passing models to `jax.vmap`, vmap'd functions to loss functions, or loss functions to JIT and grad.

Equinox additionally offers thin wrappers around `jax.jit`/`jax.grad` that understand the PyTree structure of their inputs: you can JIT/differentiate a single leaf, not just a whole argument. (We don't offer this for `jax.vmap` because interestingly `jax.vmap` offers this already.)

There's some similarities to existing libraries (like the [structs of flax.linen](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flax.struct.html) or the [functors of Flux.jl](https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/models/advanced/#Customising-Parameter-Collection-for-a-Model)), but to the best of my knowledge Equinox offers something genuinely new to the JAX framework.

### Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox.git
```
Requires Python 3.7+ and JAX 0.2.18+.

### Quick example

```python
import equinox as eqx
import functools as ft, jax, jax.numpy as jnp, jax.random as jrandom

# Define our model. `Module` subclasses are both functions and data, so we can pass them into higher
# order functions like vmap/jit/grad, or our loss function later.
# There's no magic in `Module`. Pretty much all it does is just register your class as PyTree node.
class LinearOrIdentity(eqx.Module):
    weight: jnp.ndarray
    flag: bool

    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features, flag, key):
        self.weight = jrandom.normal(key, (out_features, in_features))
        self.flag = flag

    def __call__(self, x):
        if self.flag:
            return x
        return self.weight @ x

# We use the fact that our model is data, by passing it in as an argument to the loss.
# There's no magic here: `model` is a PyTree like any other.
#
# We use filtered transformations to unpack its data and select just the leaves we want to 
# JIT+differentiate. (In this case, all floating-point JAX arrays -- `weight` but not `flag`.)
# There's no magic here: filtered transformations act on any kind of PyTree.
#
# Equinox is JAX-friendly. If you want to differentiate everything, just use `jax.jit` and `jax.grad`.
@ft.partial(eqx.jitf, filter_fn=eqx.is_inexact_array)
@ft.partial(eqx.gradf, filter_fn=eqx.is_inexact_array)
def loss(model, x, y):
    pred_y = jax.vmap(model)(x)
    return jnp.mean((y - pred_y) ** 2)

modelkey, xkey, ykey = jrandom.split(jrandom.PRNGKey(0), 3)
model = LinearOrIdentity(2, 3, flag=False, key=modelkey)
x, y = jrandom.normal(xkey, (100, 2)), jrandom.normal(ykey, (100, 3))
grads = loss(model, x, y)
```

This quick example exposes you to the two main concepts in Equinox: *callable PyTrees* and *filtered transformations*. Together, they're very powerful.

### Callable PyTrees

This is just some methods attached to a PyTree. (In this case it's the `__call__` method of a `Module` subclass.) All subclassing `Module` really does is just automatically register your class with JAX as a custom PyTree node; there's no magic here.

The PyTree structure holds the data (parameters, buffers, submodules, boolean flags, even arbitrary Python objects). The methods on the class define operations parameterised by that data -- in this case and in particular, the forward pass through a model.

This gives a way to represent *parameterised functions as data*: and as such, they're suitable for passing in and out of JAX functions. This is what we do when passing the `model` instance to the loss function.

Footnote: callable PyTrees actually aren't anything special -- the build-in Python methods on lists and dictionaries are another example of callable PyTrees.

### Filtered transformations

The one issue with putting everything about a model into a single PyTree is that this might not contain just trainable parameters. The above example includes a boolean `flag`, for example. We certainly can't differentiate this, and we may or may not wish to JIT trace/static this.<br>
In general we might have arbitrary Python objects, or perhaps JAX arrays that are buffers rather than trainable parameters.

Enter *filtered transformations*. These are `equinox.jitf` and `equinox.gradf`, which are very thin wrappers around `jax.jit` and `jax.grad`. Instead of specifying `argnums` to JIT/differentiate, we instead pass a *filter* that determines which *PyTree leaves* -- not just whole arguments -- to JIT/differentiate.

These aren't "a way to make JIT/grad work with model states" like many libraries have. They are general operations on PyTrees, and nothing about `Module` is special-cased.
- For one thing, we don't need to special-case anything: `Module` is just a PyTree like any other.
- For another, if you don't want to filter out anything at all, then don't: use `jax.jit` and `jax.grad` directly and they'll work just fine.

This gives a powerful fine-grained way control JIT and autodifferentiation.

### Integrates smoothly with JAX

There's nothing special about Equinox modules. They're just PyTrees.

There's nothing special about filtered transformations. They just operate on PyTrees.

Equinox is all just regular JAX -- PyTrees and transformations! Together, these two pieces allow us to specify complex models in JAX-friendly ways.

## Examples

- [`train_mlp.py`](./examples/train_mlp.py) gives a short example that introduces `equinox.jitf` and `equinox.gradf`. These will be used to select the parameters of an MLP and train them.
 
- [`frozen_layer.py`](./examples/frozen_layer.py) demonstrates how this approach really shines: some of the parameters will be trained, some of them will be frozen, but *all* of them will be efficiently JIT-traced.

- [`build_model.py`](./examples/build_model.py) demonstrates how to build parameterised-functions-as-data using `equinox.Module`. In particular we'll construct an MLP from scratch, and then pass it into higher-order functions like JIT and grad in order to train it. This allows us to produce models using a familiar class-based syntax, that are also functional and integrate directly with JAX's JIT/autograd.

- [`train_rnn.py`](./examples/train_rnn.py) trains an RNN on a toy clockwise/anticlockwise spiral classification problem. This demonstrates the use of `jax.lax.scan` with Equinox. (It just works, no tricks required.)

```

### Filtered transformations

```python
equinox.jitf(fun, *, filter_fn=None, filter_tree=None, **kwargs)
```
Wraps `jax.jit`.

- `fun` is a pure function to JIT compile.
- `filter_fn` is a callable `Any -> bool`. It will be called on every leaf of every PyTree that is inputted to `fun`. If it returns `True`, the leaf will be traced. It returns `False`, the leaf with be treated as static. Mutually exclusive with `filter_tree`.
- `filter_tree` is a tree, or tuple of trees, of the same length as the number of inputs. (Or if `static_argnums` is passed, the number of inputs not already marked static via `static_argnums`.) It must have the exact same tree structure as the inputs. Every leaf must be either `True` or `False`. Each leaf of `filter_tree` is matched up against the corresponding input: if it is `True` the leaf will be traced; it it is `False` the leaf will be treated as static. Mutually exclusive with `filter_tree`.
- `**kwargs` are the usual other arguments to `jax.jit`, like `static_argnums`. In particular, a leaf will be marked static if either (a) it is filtered as being so, *or* (b) it is part of a PyTree that is marked through `static_argnums`.

Precisely one of `filter_fn` or `filter_tree` must be passed.<br>
See also `equinox.is_array_like` as usually a good choice of `filter_fn`: this will trace everything that can possible be traced, with everything else static.<br>
See also `equinox.tree_at` for an easy way to create the `filter_tree` argument.

```python
equinox.gradf(fun, *, filter_fn=None, filter_tree=None, **kwargs)
```
Wraps `jax.grad`.

- `fun` is a pure function to JIT compile.
- `filter_fn` is a callable `Any -> bool`. It will be called on every leaf of every PyTree that is marked as potentially requiring gradient via `argnums`. If it returns `True`, the leaf will be differentiated. If it returns `False`, the leaf will not be differentiated. Mutually exclusive with `filter_tree`.
- `filter_tree` is a tree, or tuple of trees, of the same length as the number of inputs marked as potentially requiring gradient via `argnums`. It must have the exact same tree structure as the inputs. Every leaf must be either `True` or `False`. Each leaf of `filter_tree` is matched up against the corresponding input: if it is `True` the leaf will be differentiated; if it is `False` the leaf will not be differentiated. Mutually exclusive with `filter_fn`.
- `**kwargs` are the usual other argments to `jax.grad`, like `argnums`. In particular, a leaf will only be differentiated if (a) it is filtered as being so, *and* (b) it is part of a PyTree that is marked through `argnums`.

Precisely one of `filter_fn` or `filter_tree` must be passed.<br>
See also `equinox.is_inexact_array` as usually a good choice of `filter_fn`: this will differentiate all floating-point arrays.<br>
See also `equinox.tree_at` for an easy way to create the `filter_tree` argument.

Note that as the returned gradients must have the same structure as the inputs, then all nondifferentiable components of the input PyTrees will have gradient `None`. 
Doing a simple `jax.tree_map(lambda m, g: m - lr * g, model, grad)` will fail. 
As such Equinox provides `equinox.apply_updates` as a simple convenience: it will only apply the update if the gradient is not `None`. See below.

```python
equinox.value_and_grad_f(fun, *, filter_fn=None, filter_tree=None, **kwargs)
```
Wraps `jax.value_and_grad`. Arguments are as `equinox.gradf`.

### Filters

Any function `Any -> bool` can be used as a filter. We provide some convenient common choices.

```python
equinox.is_inexact_array(element)
```
Returns `True` if `element` is a floating point JAX array (but not a NumPy array).

```python
equinox.is_array_like(element)
```
Returns `True` if `element` can be interpreted as a JAX array. (i.e. does `jax.numpy.array` throw an exception or not.)

### Module

```python
equinox.Module
```
Base class; create your model by inheriting from this.

Specify all its attributes at the class level (identical to [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)). This defines its children in the PyTree.

```python
class MyModule(equinox.Module):
    weight: typing.Any
    bias: typing.Any
    submodule: Module
```

In this case a default `__init__` method is provided, which just fills in these attributes with the argments passed: `MyModule(weight, bias, submodule)` or `MyModule(weight=weight, bias=bias, submodule=submodule)`. Alternatively you can provide an `__init__` method yourself. (For example to specify dimension sizes instead of raw weights.) By the end of `__init__`, every attribute must have been assigned.

```python
class AnotherModule(equinox.Module):
    weight: Any

    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size, key):
        self.weight = jax.random.normal(key, (output_size, input_size))
```

After initialisation then attributes cannot be modified: models are immutable as per functional programming. (Parameter updates are made by creating a new model, not by mutating parameters in-place; see for example [`train_mlp.py`](./examples/train_mlp.py).)

It is typical to also create some methods on the class. As `self` will be an input parameter -- treated as a PyTree -- then these methods will get access to the attributes of the instance. Defining `__call__` gives an easy way to define a forward pass for a model:

```python
class LinearWithoutBias(equinox.Module):
    weight: Any

    def __call__(self, x):
        return self.weight @ x
```

If defining a method `meth`, then take care not to write `instance = MyModule(...); jax.jit(instance.meth)(...)`. (Or similarly with `jax.grad`, `equinox.jitf` etc.) This is because `instance.meth` is not a pure function as it already has the `self` parameter passed implicitly. Instead do either `jax.jit(MyModule.meth)(instance, ...)` or
```python
@jax.jit
def func(instance, args):
    instance.meth(args)
    # Also use this pattern with instance(args) if you defined `__call__` instead of `meth`.
```

### Utilities

```python
equinox.apply_updates(model, updates)
```
Performs a training update to a model.
- `model` must be a PyTree;
- `updates` must be a PyTree with the same structure.

It essentially performs `jax.tree_map(lambda m, u: m + u, model, updates)`. However anywhere `updates` is `None` then no update is made at all, so as to handle nondifferentiable parts of `model`.

The returned value is the updated model. (`model` is *not* mutated in place, as is usual in JAX and functional programming.)

To produce `updates`, it is typical to take the gradients from the loss function, and then adjust them according to any standard optimiser; for example [Optax](https://github.com/deepmind/optax) provides `optax.sgd` or `optax.adam`.

```python
equinox.tree_at(where, pytree, replace=_sentinel, replace_fn=_sentinel)
```
Modifies an existing tree, and returns the modified tree. (Like `.at` for "in place modifications" of JAX arrays.)

- `where` is a callable `PyTree -> Leaf` or `PyTree -> Tuple[Leaf, ...]`. It should consume a PyTree of the same shape as `pytree`, and return the leaf or leaves that should be replaced. For example `where=lambda mlp: mlp.layers[-1].linear.weight`.
- `pytree` is the existing PyTree to modify.
- `replace` should either be a single element, or a tuple of the same length as returned by `where`. This specifies the replacements to make at the locations specified by `where`. Mutually exclusive with `replace_fn`.
- `replace_fn` should be a function `Leaf -> Any`. It will be called on every leaf replaced using `where`. The return value from `replace_fn` will be used in its place. Mutually exclusive with `replace`.

For example this can be used to specify the weights of a model to train or not train:
```python
trainable = jax.tree_map(lambda _: False, model)
trainable = equinox.tree_at(lambda mlp: mlp.layers[-1].linear.weight, model, replace=True)
equinox.gradf(..., filter_tree=trainable)
```

```python
equinox.tree_equal(*pytrees)
```
Returns `True` if all PyTrees in the list are equal. All arrays must have the same shape, dtype, and values. JAX arrays and NumPy arrays are not considered equal.

### Neural network library

Equinox includes a small neural network library, mostly as a tech demo for how the rest of the library can be used. Its API is modelled after PyTorch.

```python
equinox.nn.Linear(in_features, out_features, bias=True, *, key)(input)
equinox.nn.Identity(*args, **kwargs)(input)  # args and kwargs are ignored
equinox.nn.Dropout(p=0.5, deterministic=False)(input, *, key=None, deterministic=None)
equinox.nn.GRUCell(input_size, hidden_size, bias=True, *, key)(input, hidden)
equinox.nn.LSTMCell(input_size, hidden_size, bias=True, *, key)(input, hidden)
equinox.nn.Sequential(layers)(input, *, key=None)
equinox.nn.MLP(in_size, out_size, width_size, depth,
               activation=jax.nn.relu, final_activation=lambda x: x, *, key)(input)
```
These all behave in the way you expect. The `key` arguments are used to generate the random initial weights, or to generate randomness on the forward pass of stochastic layers like `Dropout`.

The `Dropout(deterministic=...)(deterministic=...)` options determines whether to have the layer act as the identity function, as is commonly done with dropout during inference time. The call-time `deterministic` takes precendence if it passed; otherwise the init-time `deterministic` is used. (Note that because models are PyTrees, you can modify the init-time `deterministic` flag using `equinox.tree_at`. This is perfectly fine, and might be handy if it's easier than using the call-time flag.)

The `MLP(final_activation=...)` option determines any final activation function to apply after the last layer. (In some cases it is desirable for this to be different to the activation used in the main part of the network.)
